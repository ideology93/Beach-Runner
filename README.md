# Beach-Runner
Unity Runner type game, using free assets and trying out Unity's Universal Pipeline
--------------
Facebook SDK and GameAnalytics SDK implemented 
-------------
Run the Jump button version, improved ui etc.
--------------
Also playing around with Unity CharacterController, so far its alright but the isGrounded function constantly has issues regardless of how much gravity is applied, might revert to Rigidbodies in next projects.
